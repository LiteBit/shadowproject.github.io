				<dt>What is Shadow?</dt>
				<dd>
					Shadow is a truly unique project, spawned from Bitcoin, over 6 months of development has transformed the pseudonymous Bitcoin into the first true anonymous decentralized cryptocurrency &ndash; Shadowcash. In traditional financial terms, other cryptocurrencies represent the trackable check or card option, while Shadow is cash. ShadowSend‘s unique zero-knowledge, dual-key stealth address and ring signature protocol enables near-instant, untraceable, unlinkable and trustless transactions.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>Who controls the Shadow network?</dt>
				<dd>
					Nobody owns the Shadow network much like no one owns the technology behind email. Shadow is controlled by all Shadow users around the world. While developers are improving the software, they can't force a change in the Shadow protocol because all users are free to choose what software and version they use. In order to stay compatible with each other, all users need to use software complying with the same rules. Shadow can only work correctly with a complete consensus among all users. Therefore, all users and developers have a strong incentive to protect this consensus.

				<dt>How do I acquire ShadowCash?</dt>
				<dd>
					You can buy ShadowCash on <a href="https://bittrex.com/Market/Index?MarketName=BTC-SDC">Bittrex</a> or <a href="https://poloniex.com/exchange#btc_sdc">Poloniex</a>.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>What happens when ShadowCash gets lost?</dt>
				<dd>
					When a user loses his wallet, it has the effect of removing money out of circulation. Lost ShadowCash still remain in the block chain just like any other ShadowCash. However, lost ShadowCash remain dormant forever because there is no way for anybody to find the private key(s) that would allow them to be spent again. Because of the law of supply and demand, when fewer ShadowCash are available, the ones that are left will be in higher demand and increase in value to compensate.

			<dl>
				<dt>Is Shadow anonymous?</dt>
				<dd>
					Yes. ShadowSend‘s unique zero-knowledge, dual-key stealth address and ring signature protocol enables near-instant, untraceable, unlinkable and trustless transactions.
				</dd>
			</dl>
			<dl>
				<dt>Is Shadow legal?</dt>
				<dd>
					To the best of our knowledge, digital currency like ShadowCash have not been made illegal by legislation in most jurisdictions. However, some jurisdictions (such as Argentina and Russia) severely restrict or ban foreign currencies. Other jurisdictions (such as Thailand) may limit the licensing of certain entities such as ShadowCash exchanges. Regulators from various jurisdictions are taking steps to provide individuals and businesses with rules on how to integrate this new technology with the formal, regulated financial system. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), a bureau in the United States Treasury Department, issued non-binding guidance on how it characterizes certain activities involving virtual currencies.

				<dt>What is a decentralised P2P network?</dt>
				<dd>
					Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or work loads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided. Emerging collaborative P2P systems are going beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources, and are looking for diverse peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a virtual community thereby empowering it to engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers, yet that are beneficial to all the peers.
